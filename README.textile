h1. Gallery

This is the full source-code of my "Gallery" Ruby On Rails 4.0 web application.

This is an extension of the concept of a "home page", or a Facebook Wall.

The application includes an image gallery section, and editable/data-driven sections that show links to blogging related to various other hobbies and projects.

Think of this as example code, or  modify it to suit your purposes.

The primary tools used in this app are:
* Ruby on Rails v. 4.x
* Ruby v 2.x
* Rubber/Capistrano for deployment to Amazon Cloud Computing AWS EC2
* Twitter Bootstrap for basic formatting
* CSS
* HAML
* RSpec ( with FactoryGirl for test data)
* CoffeeScript, jQuery, jQuery UI for client-side code
* numerous popular gems to reduce coding and standardize the approach to common tasks



This application was started with the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem provided by the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.io/.
