          I designed and built this website at the end of 2013 in order to have a showcase for my (mis)adventures and to sharpen my coding skills with the most modern versions of my preferred web development frameworks and tools.

        %p
          There is a nearly endless set of tools used in modern web-application development, and while not exhaustive, here is a list of the primary tools used here:
          %ul
            %li Ruby On Rails 4.x
            %li Ruby 2.x
            %li HTML5, CSS3, Haml and jQuery (CoffeeScript)
            %li Page Layout via Twitter Bootstrap (using CSS, Sass, and a fair bit of cursing)
            %li Test Driven Design using RSpec, Capybara, Guard, Factory Girl
            %li Deployment to Amazon AWS (Rails "in the cloud") using Rubber/Capistrano
          
        %p
          While I have worked with Rails since version 1.0 (2007) and various website projects since the turn of the century, I am roughly halfway through a 60 year career as a software engineer.  Other epochs in my software engineering carreer have included such things as Macintosh development, iOS software development, Palm Pilot software development and embedded C and C++ work on ARM processors in the cell-phone industry.

          My Engineering degree is from the Science/Engineering campus of the University of Missouri in Rolla.

          I currently make my living as a Ruby on Rails developer and an Artificial Intelligence specialist.
