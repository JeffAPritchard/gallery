          I am an Engineer and an Artist and a Tinkerer.  Think Edison crossed with da Vinci crossed with MacGyver (but muted with a tasteful level of modesty).

          While there isn't any one label that really describes me well, a few "tags" I wear with honor would be: Engineer, Creative, Nature Lover, Persistent.

        %p
          Most people who know me well would likely describe me as "always off on some project or another."  Probably that's a reasonable description of me 
          (though I'm likely to think of them more generously as "adventures").

        %p
          One is equally likely to find me either parked in front of a computer, or hacking away in my workshop, or sitting quietly in the woods leaning up against a tree.
