Things to do to this app:

Add changes suggested by Tanya on landing page

Figure out why guard is not running all relevant tests sometimes

Figure out how to make the boilerplate rspec tests for categories and activities happy with authorization

Still a bug lurking in the prev/next buttons of large tab

Work on the CSS for all parts of the app

Do some capybara testing for javascript stuff

improve the wordpress content some more

Use the "Friendly_ID" gem to clean up the urls for project screens

Want to be able to set a position value for each activity in a category -- admin for changing position and UI changes to support it

-------------------

track users with cookies so when they come back I can show them their own favorites (automatically make a user)

Track the time a user spends on a particular image and use that as one metric of "awesomeness"

provide a way for users to star-rate images

track viewings (views of the large-sized image) as a type of rating

provide sharing buttons and track how many times an image has been shared as another awesomeness factor

provide some filter tabs for choosing how to order/filter images based on awesomeness

provide a "lightbulb" icon in gallery screens to "turn out the lights" and provide totally black background via CSS

add tags to many of the images for water, trees, flowers, etc. and add a way to filter by tags

provide ordering by "most recent", "highest ratings", "most viewed"
