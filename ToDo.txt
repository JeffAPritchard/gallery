Things to do to this app:


Use the "Friendly_ID" gem to clean up the urls for project screens

Track the time a user spends on a particular image and use that as one metric of "awesomeness"

provide a way for users to star-rate images

track viewings (views of the large-sized image) as a type of rating

track users with cookies so when they come back I can show them their own favorites

provide sharing buttons and track how many times an image has been shared as another awesomeness factor

provide some filter tabs for choosing how to order/filter images based on awesomeness

provide a "lightbulb" icon in gallery screens to "turn out the lights" and provide totally black background via CSS

add tags to many of the images for water, trees, flowers, etc. and add a way to filter by tags

provide ordering by "most recent", "highest ratings", "most viewed"
